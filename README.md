Pink Data Lab
About

Pink Data Lab is my personal portfolio website, created to present my professional journey, projects, and transition into the data analytics field.

This space combines technology, creativity, and analytical thinking, reflecting both my technical background and my personal identity.

Purpose

The purpose of Pink Data Lab is to:

Present my professional profile in a clear and accessible way

Showcase selected projects in data analytics and web development

Serve as a central hub connecting my work, studies, and online presence

Visual Identity

The visual identity of Pink Data Lab is intentional.

Pink represents confidence, sensitivity, and strength — values that align with my approach to technology and data.
In a field traditionally dominated by neutral tones, this project embraces color as a way to express authenticity while maintaining professionalism.
